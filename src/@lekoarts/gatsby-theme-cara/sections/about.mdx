## About

#### Hi! I'm Daryl, a software engineer based in Raleigh, North Carolina. 

I love creating websites, applications, and technology products that solve problems, are fun, and offer seamless user experiences.
I currently work with Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm very open to experimenting and working with new technologies to expand my skill-set!
